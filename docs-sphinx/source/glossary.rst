**Scope 1 Emissions** are direct GHG emissions that include fuel combustion, company vehicles and fugitive emissions.
These emissions are direct GHG emissions that happen from sources owned or controlled by an organization including fuel
combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles.

    **Boilers** burn biological plant material – predominantly wood – in order to generate heat or both heat &
    electricity for combined units.

    **Simple-cycle combustion turbines** propel hot gas through a turbine in order to generate electricity.

    **Combined-cycle combustion turbines** uses both a gas and a steam turbine together to produce up to 50% more
    electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant.

    **Engines** covert energy from fuel to some mechanical energy.

    **Incinerators** burn waste to boil water that may power steam generators that generate electric energy and heat.

    **Process heaters** generate energy using either fuel-based, electricity-based, heat transfer media (steam, hot
    water, thermal fluid), or hybrid technologies to provide the hear energy required for various manufacturing
    operations.

    **Flares** are a high-temperature oxidation process used to burn combustible components, mostly
    hydrocarbons, of waste gases from industrial operations. Natural gas, propane, ethylene, propylene,
    butadiene and butane constitute over 95 percent of the waste gases flared.

    **Thermal oxidizers**, or thermal incinerators, are combustion devices that control VOC, :math:`\text{CO}`, and volatile HAP
    emissions by combusting them to carbon dioxide (:math:`\text{CO}_2`) and water. Thermal oxidizers are similar to catalytic
    oxidizers (catalytic oxidizers use a catalyst to promote the oxidation reaction).
        **VOC**: Volatile Organic Compounds

        **HAP**: Hazardous Air Pollutants

**Scope 2 Emissions** are electricity indirect GHG emissions that include emissions from consumption of purchased
electricity, heat, cooling or steam. These emissions are a result of a company's activities but often occur outside a
company's physical facility.

**Scope 3 Emissions** are other indirect GHG emissions that include all emissions not covered by scope 1 and scope 2
emissions and include the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, transport-related activities in
vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity, electricity-related activities (e.g. transmission and
distribution (T&D) losses) not covered in Scope 2, outsourced activities, waste disposal, etc. These emissions are the
result the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization, but that the
organization indirectly impacts in its value chain.
