Offsets
-------
Offsets calculates the total purchased :math:`\text{CO}_2` offsets by summing up the inputs of offsets purchased.

The fundamental calculation for offsets is their :math:`\text{CO}_2\; Equivalent\; Emission\; Reductions`

The formulas is:

.. math::

    \text{CO}_2\; Equivalent\; Emission\; Reductions = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} Purchased\; Offset_{n}

where :math:`Purchased\; Offset_{n}` is the amount of offsets that have been purchased during the reporting period for
one entry in the offsets table.
