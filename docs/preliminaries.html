<li><p>EPA SGEC seems to be using the global warming potential (GWP) values from AR4 (IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report)
from 2007. The GHG Protocol calculator tool gives the option for using the AR4 or AR5 (IPCC’s Fifth Assessment
Report) from 2014. AR6 (IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report) came out in 2021
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#FullReport">https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#FullReport</a>) and has the most up to date GWP factors for greenhouse
gases/refrigerants in the chapter 7 supplementary material:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter_07_Supplementary_Material.pdf">https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter_07_Supplementary_Material.pdf</a>
Incorporating these values would put the library at the forefront of current climate science and may
make the library more attractive to businesses involved in markets with mandatory reporting (as the regulatory
agencies may demand more up to date emissions estimates).
Note: the GWP factors used in computing CO2 equivalent emissions are the 100 year values (column header GWP
100). This is true in both EPA’s SGEC and GHG Protocol’s GHG Emissions Calculation Tool.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be a caveat to the above change to factors. It may be the case that factors and/or equations to be
used for carbon accounting are enshrined in law for different countries. For example, see: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/part-98/subpart-C">https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/part-98/subpart-C</a></p></li>
<li><p>The EU (including UK) seem to have different emissions standards for vehicles. In the EU, vehicles are classified
into Stages depending on the motor power and other variables. The stages were introduced over time and set
upper limits to CO2, NO_x, and HC (hydrocarbons) emissions per quantity fuel combusted. Note NO2 is contained in
NO_x and CH4 is contained in HC. See <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_emission_standards">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_emission_standards</a>. It is unclear if
the UK will change emissions standards after Brexit.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>As a general principle, we should take as much pre-computing out of the hands of the user as possible. (Should the
library support a “turbotax” like app for carbon accounting?)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>In mobile sources, if the fuel usage associated with a vehicle is not known, but the mileage is then the EPA’s
SGEC directs the user to calculate the fuel usage based on a reference chart of approximate fuel efficiencies
per vehicle. This can be done by the library. (I’m not sure if the simplified material balance is doing this
already, but the language used to discuss the inputs across the two tables is different).</p></li>
<li><p>On the Refrigeration and AC page the material balance method gives instructions on how to calculate input
fields to the table. Those could be the inputs to a more granular method, which then leverages the current
method for calculation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Change stationary_combustion_emission_factors to only take greenhouse gas as key and eliminate dual internal unit
dependence. Currently, the stationary combustion page and the steam page both use
stationary_combustion_emission_factors, and calculate emissions for nearly the same set of fuel types. However,
the internal units that each convert to are different for each fuel type. E.g., anthraciteCoal has an internal
unit of short tons on the stationary combustion page and mmBtu on the steam page. However, the user may enter in
anthraciteCoal fuel combusted in units of mmbtu on the stationary combustion page (which are converted to short
tons using heat content factors), and then uses the “CO2 Factor (kg / Unit)” key to get CO2 emissions for the
short ton converted value. The steam page only allows for steam purchased in mmbtu, and then the CO2 emissions
factors are retrieved using the “CO2 Factor (kg / mmBtu)” key in stationary_combustion_emission_factors. This is
flawed design - there should only be one internal unit that the greenhouse gas factors are associated with
(e.g., mmbtu ) for each fuel type and all input values’ units should be converted to that one internal unit before
calculating GHG emissions instead of maintaining multiple sets of GHG factors.</p></li>
<li><p>GWP factors for blended refrigerants are not accurate. If the blended refrigerant contains any HFC gas that has
been phased out in the US due to EPA regulation, then that gas’ GWP contribution to the blend is set to 0.
Therefore every blended refrigerant with this property has a GWP which is less (sometimes absurdly so) than its
actual value. E.g., R-409A is a blend of 60% HCFC-22, 25% HCFC-124, and 15% HCFC-142b, all three of which have
been phased out in the US, yet its GWP is 0. This seems highly problematic, especially for markets outside the US
where these refrigerants may still be in use.</p></li>
<li><p>Make references to CO2, CH4, and N2O keys in factors consistent across all. Some factors have lowercase while
others have upper, e.g., “co2” vs “CO2”.</p></li>
<li><p>make_molecular_weights in create_conversion_constants.py could be refactored as it opens one page multiple times
(may not be necessary as this is likely an approximately one time use function)</p></li>
<li><p>Standardize emissions calculations for CO2, CH4 and N2O in formulas (staticmethods) into one equation that takes
the gas as an argument (which then will be passed on to the factors to get the corresponding emission factor for
the gas) for those formulae that calculate CH4 and N2O in addition to CO2.</p></li>
