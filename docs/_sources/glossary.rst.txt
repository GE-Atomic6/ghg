**Scope 1 Emissions** are direct GHG emissions that include fuel combustion, company vehicles and fugitive emissions.
These emissions are direct GHG emissions that happen from sources owned or controlled by an organization including fuel
combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles.

    **Boilers** burn biological plant material – predominantly wood – in order to generate heat or both heat &
    electricity for combined units.

    **Simple-cycle combustion turbines** propel hot gas through a turbine in order to generate electricity.

    **Combined-cycle combustion turbines** uses both a gas and a steam turbine together to produce up to 50% more
    electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant.

    **Engines** covert energy from fuel to some mechanical energy.

    **Incinerators** burn waste to boil water that may power steam generators that generate electric energy and heat.

    **Process heaters** generate energy using either fuel-based, electricity-based, heat transfer media (steam, hot
    water, thermal fluid), or hybrid technologies to provide the hear energy required for various manufacturing
    operations.

    **Fire suppressant** systems are used to extinguish or control fires, and are activated by hear, smoke, or a
    combination of the two.

**Scope 2 Emissions** are electricity indirect GHG emissions that include emissions from consumption of purchased
electricity, heat, cooling or steam. These emissions are a result of a company's activities but often occur outside a
company's physical facility.

**Scope 3 Emissions** are other indirect GHG emissions that include all emissions not covered by scope 1 and scope 2
emissions and include the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, transport-related activities in
vehicles not owned or controlled by the reporting entity, electricity-related activities (e.g. transmission and
distribution (T&D) losses) not covered in Scope 2, outsourced activities, waste disposal, etc. These emissions are the
result the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization, but that the
organization indirectly impacts in its value chain.

    **Refuse**, also called municipal solid waste, is nonhazardous solid waste that requires collection and transport to
    a processing or disposal site. Refuse includes garbage and rubbish.

    **Sludge** is any solid, semi-solid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or industrial
    wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility exclusive of the treated
    effluent from a wastewater treatment plant.

    **Vehicle Miles** is a measure used extensively in transportation planning. It measures the amount of travel for
    all vehicles in a geographic region over a given period of time.

    **Ton-Miles** is a term used to refer to one ton of freight carried one miles, as a unit of traffic. Ton-miles
    should not be calculated by simply multiplying total miles by total tons - this calculation effectively assumes
    that the entire tonnage is transported on each and every truck, railcar, aircraft, or barge and will likely
    overstate ton-miles.

**Carbon Storage** also known as carbon sequestration, is a complex method of capturing carbon dioxide emissions and
storing them in coal seams, aquifers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs and other spaces deep under the surface of the
Earth.
