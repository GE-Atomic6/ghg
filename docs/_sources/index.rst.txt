Atomic6 GHG
===================================================================
Welcome to Atomic6 GHG's documentation.
Carbon (C) is the element whose atom contains six protons and is identified as atomic number 6.
Atomic6 GHG is a convenient source of carbon math for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculations in Python based software.
Initial versions of the package are specific to US-based operations.
The API is modeled on and certified with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) simplified
greenhouse gas emissions calculator (SGEC).
The API supports direct and indirect calculations for the following scope 1, 2, and 3
emissions and offsets:

* Scope 1
    * :ref:`stationary-combustion-api`
    * :ref:`mobile-sources-api`
    * :ref:`refrigeration-and-ac-api`
    * :ref:`fire-suppression-api`
    * :ref:`purchased-gases-api`
    * :ref:`waste-gases-api`
* Scope 2
    * :ref:`electricity-api`
    * :ref:`steam-api`
* Scope 3
    * :ref:`business-travel-api`
    * :ref:`commuting-api`
    * :ref:`product-transport-api`
    * :ref:`waste-api`
* :ref:`offsets-api`

Additional SGEC Info
--------------------
* :ref:`sgec-factors`
* :ref:`sgec-schemas`
* :ref:`sgec-certification`

We recommend using the latest version of Python. Atomic6-ghg supports Python 3.9 and newer.
